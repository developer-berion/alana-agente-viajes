# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md - Travel-Mind B2B

## Executive Summary
Travel-Mind is a high-performance B2B travel advisory system designed for travel wholesalers. It leverages state-of-the-art Generative AI to provide accurate, grounded recommendations based on proprietary promotion PDFs, mitigating financial risks (ADMs) and drastically reducing search time for travel agents.

## Project Status (Final Delivery)
- **Deployment Status:** 🟢 Production Live (Optimized)
- **Production URL:** [https://travel-mind-prod-awpc74oijq-uc.a.run.app](https://travel-mind-prod-awpc74oijq-uc.a.run.app)
- **Core Engine:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (Zero-Waste & High-Utility Configuration)
- **Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Run (Containerized mono-repo)
- **Persistence:** Google Cloud Firestore (Native Mode)

## Stakeholder Value
- **Project Managers:** Single source of truth for all trip promotions, ensuring consistency across the sales team.
- **Engineering Leads:** Robust, scalable CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions; dual-process container architecture (FastAPI + Streamlit).
- **Developers:** Clean API contracts and modular agent logic using standard Google Cloud SDKs.

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Gemini 2.5 Pro Engine:** Selected for ultra-low latency and advanced reasoning over complex RAG datasets.
2. **Immutable Persistence:** Every user interaction and agent response is stored as an immutable legal record in Firestore.
3. **Internal Orchestration:** Custom `entrypoint.sh` manages process health, ensuring the Backend API is healthy before the Frontend UI becomes accessible.
4. **Transparent Grounding:** Responses MUST include direct URI citations to source PDFs in GCS.
5. **Zero-Waste Communication:** Surgical response logic implemented to reduce token waste and improve latency by providing Minimum Viable Responses.
